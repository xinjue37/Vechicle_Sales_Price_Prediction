## Vechicle Price Prediction Analysis Process

| Step | Description |Analysis|
|------|-------------|:--|
| **1. Initial Considerations/Thought** | Generally, to perform valuation on a car, we needs: <ul><li>Car Brand</li><li>Initial Price</li><li>Car Mileage (Odometer)</li><li>Car Age</li><li>Exterior & Interior Condition</li><li>Trim Level (BadgeDescription)</li><li>Accident History (from VIN)</li><li>Market Demand</li><li>Car Apperance</li></ul> |--|
| **2. Basic Data Understanding** | <ul><li>62,192 data points</li><li>130 features (64 float64, 60 object, 6 int64)</li><li>Features grouped into **10 categories (scroll to below for details)**</li><li>44 records where Sold_Amount > NewPrice (valid due to resale/antique value)</li></ul> |--|
| **3. Feature Removal** | Remove features that are: <ul><li><b>Redundant</b>: MakeCode (Make), FamilyCode (Model), SeriesModelYear (YearGroup)</li><li><b>Identifiers</b>: SequenceNum, DriveCode, VIN, ModelCode, EngineNum</li><li><b>Constant Value</b>: ImportFlag, NormalChargeMins, NormalChargeVoltage, TopSpeedElectricEng</li><li><b>Leakage/Cause degenerate feedback loop</b>: AvgWholesale, AvgRetail, GoodWholesale, GoodRetail, TradeMin, TradeMax, PrivateMax</li></ul> |--|
|**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**|<ul><li>To find out some possible useful insights from the features</li><li>just perform simple EDA due to time constraints</li></ul>|This dataset contains cars from 1962 to 2017, with missing values being common and outliers frequently present due to the inclusion of luxury vehicles. The distribution of **Sold_Amount** is heavily right-skewed, with most vehicles sold below 40,000, and some high-value outliers likely representing luxury vehicles. The correlation heatmap shows a weak positive correlation between NewPrice and Sold_Amount, and a weak negative correlation between Age_Comp_Months and KM with Sold_Amount. This is expected, as Sold_Amount tends to align with the original price and decreases with increased usage and age.|
| **5. Feature Engineering** | <ul><li>Add accident history (from VIN) - **left it aside due to time constraint**</li><li>Incorporate car appearance (via images) - **left it aside due to time constraint**</li><li>Convert date fields into year, month, day, weekday</li></ul> |--|
| **6. Encoding Categorical Data** | **One-Hot Encoding with "Other" Category:** <br>* Reduces dimensionality by collapsing low-frequency categories into "Other."<br>* Pros: Prevents rare/unseen categories from breaking inference pipelines.<br>* Cons: Loss of granularity; "Other" may dilute meaningful signals.<br><br>**Target Encoding:**<br>* Maps categories to the mean target value.<br>* Risks: Data leakage if encoding is not strictly separated during cross-validation, leading to overoptimistic performance.<br><br>**Feature Hashing (n=100)**: <br>* Projects categories into a fixed-dimensional space via hash functions.<br>* Pros: Memory-efficient, handles unseen categories gracefully.<br>* Cons: Irreversible (loss of interpretability), potential hash collisions.|--|
| **7. Model Building & Training** | **Algorithm Choice**: Tree-based models (XGBoost, CatBoost) were selected for inherent handling of missing data and nonlinear relationships.<br><br>**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Limited tuning (n_iter=10, cv=3) due to resource constraints and this is just a prove of concept. |--|
| **8. Model Evaluation** | Perform slice-based evaluation by the `Make` feature to analyze model performance across car brands.  |Among **three different embedding methods**, one-hot encoding resulted in higher performance overall. <br>Among **three different tree-based ML models**, they performed similarly, with no significant variation in **R¬≤**, **RMSE**, or **MAE**. <br>This suggests that categorical features are underutilized, implying the model relies primarily on **NewPrice**, **Age_Comp_Months**, and **KM**.|
| **9. Feature Importance Analysis** |Analyze and compare which features are most important to each model.|The consistent high importance of "NewPrice", "Age_Comp_Months" & "KM" across different models (XGBoost and CatBoost) and various categorical encoding techniques (One-hot encoding, Target encoding, and Feature hashing) strongly suggests that the original price of a vehicle, the car's age, and the car Mileage is a fundamental predictor of its current market value.|
| **10. Inference Pipeline** | <ul><li>Build a pipeline for making predictions on unseen data.</li><li>show how it handles new categorical data</li></ul>|--|

>  **CONCLUSION FROM ANALYSIS**: In conclusion, the limitations of current models in leveraging categorical features, such as vehicle descriptions, hinder optimal car price prediction. The inability of traditional encoding methods to capture semantic and hierarchical relationships within the data highlights the need for more advanced techniques, such as neural network-based entity embeddings or BERT for textual inputs. Furthermore, enriching the feature space with market trends and vehicle-specific attributes can provide additional context, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable vehicle price predictions.

## Possible Strategic Recommendations for Business Optimization
| **Possible Enhancement**                     | **Details** |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **A) Enhance Categorical Feature Representation** | <ul><li>Experiment with hierarchical embeddings (e.g., brand ‚Üí model ‚Üí year) or NLP techniques for text descriptions.</li><li>Collect additional metadata (e.g., trim level, optional features) to reduce ambiguity.</li><li>After categorical features are well used, we can possibly move on to analyse the impact of unseen categories on the ML models.</li></ul> |
| **B) Luxury Car Segmentation**   | <ul><li>Luxury cars represent niche markets with distinct pricing dynamics. Failing to model these outliers accurately could lead to underpricing high-margin inventory.</li><li>Train separate models for luxury vs. non-luxury vehicles to address skewness and distinct pricing factors (e.g., brand prestige, limited editions).</li></ul> |
| **C) Dynamic Pricing Integration** | <ul><li>Incorporate real-time market data (e.g., fuel prices, competitor listings) to adapt to demand fluctuations.</li></ul> |
| **D) Model Robustness**          | <ul><li>Increase hyperparameter tuning iterations (`n_iter ‚â• 50`) and cross-validation folds (`cv=5`) for production-grade models.</li></ul> |
| **E) Business Metrics Alignment** | <ul><li>Map RMSE/MAE to profit margins (e.g., a `1,000` prediction error equates to `X` loss per transaction).</li><li>Use slice-based evaluation to identify underperforming segments (e.g., electric vehicles) for targeted improvements.</li></ul> |
